## Messenger - Floating Quick Replies

### The Goal

Drive more conversation starts by displaying floating Quick Replies outside of Messenger thereby enticing the customer to being a conversation.

### Current State

Messenger has Conversation Auto-Start in Beta and releasing GA on September 14th. When Auto-Start is enabled, as soon as Messenger is opened, a "Customer Joined" event is sent behind the scenes triggering the inbound message flow. Most commonly, the first action in the flow is a bot reply of some sort.

### The Idea

WW display the initial question + Quick Reply buttons of the bot flow outside of Messenger before the user has opened Messenger? By "starting" the conversation outside of Messenger, customers may be more likely to start the conversation when they otherwise may not have.
